                <b> This project was definitely the most challenging thing I've taken on scale-wise. 20 cards, 40 surfaces is no joke. Though my subject matter 
                    of voice initially complicated my approach, my grid system ended up making the project less conceptually difficult and more simply a trial of
                    patience and time. I was willing to fill those boxes in, and so things worked out.

                    <div class="smallbr"> </div>

                    While succesful, this approach came at the cost of time which I could have spent refining my interaction with the cards. I didn't get the chance
                    to test and experiment with how people explore my cards very much, which is unfortunate. Well, you win some and you lose some :D
