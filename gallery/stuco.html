                    The previous StuCo logo, though fun, didn’t do a great job at indicating that StuCo actually is a short-form for two different words. Our early work then focused on highlighting both the “Student” and the “College”, as well as better matching the lively, scrappy nature of the organization. Through iteration guided and assisted by Isis Berymon, the sticky-note motif emerged as a way to bring color, funk, and modularity to the brand.                </b>

                <b>
                    Inspired by the previous logo's tall typography, as well as the proud and funky nature of CMU's students, we wanted to choose sans-serif typefaces that express themselves with strength. Akshar struck the right tone and looks great in all caps, however on it's own it can be monotonous. Unbounded brings width and edge that compliments Akshar, hopefully creating intrigue.

We took these classic CMU colors, and injected a bit of StuCo funk into them, even giving them fun campus-related names. Pink was added because it just feels right*
