                    Inspired by the previous logo's tall typography, as well as the proud and funky nature of CMU's students, we wanted to choose sans-serif typefaces that express themselves with strength. Akshar struck the right tone and looks great in all caps, however on it's own it can be monotonous. Unbounded brings width and edge that compliments Akshar, hopefully creating intrigue.
