                            Roughly 325,000 businesses, homes, and other establishments lack high-speed internet access in Pennsylvania. The vast majority of these people live within underserved, often overlooked rural communities.

                            With the support of Aadil Ginwala, senior policy advisor at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh and former chief of staff of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, my task was to propose a potential design system to speak to rural communities and bolster ongoing efforts to close Pennsylvania's digital divide.

                My approach was:
                <div class="smallbr"> </div>    
                1. Finding businesses and municipal buildings in underserved towns that have an existing online presence (a website, google reviews, etc.)
                <div class="smallbr"> </div>    
                2. Cold-calling and emailing these establishments in the hopes that they would be willing to talk about their experiences with their internet.
            
                <div class="smallbr"></div>
                Using <a href="https://internetxplorer.org/#/advertised-service" target="_blank"> Internet Xplorer </a>
                I narrowed down my case study search to Western PA, and began making a list of any possible high-speed internet hotspots surrounded by “dead-zones”, so I could find community members to talk to.
                <div class="smallbr"> </div>    
    
                My plan seemed alright - but from my results I found that:

            </h1>

                <div class="smallbr"> </div>  

            Only one person, a kind lady in Sandy Lake, answered my call and actually spoke to me for a few minutes about her internet. However, I can’t blame all the other people I contacted - why would they want to talk to me, especially if their internet is serviceable?

            While my lack of research was a bummer, it reiterated to me that it’s hard to care about the internet conditions of neighbouring towns and counties if you’re not actively  reminded of them.
            <div class="smallbr"></div>
            It was clear then, that my campaign’s direction should be to emphasize the importance of connection, and the similarity between high-speed internet and other connective public necessities like roads and electricity.

            With this in mind I focused my efforts on Titusville in Crawford County, which has plenty of high-speed internet connections and a lot of small-town neighbors who don’t enjoy similar “luxuries”.

            Pennsylvania’s government has an established style that every resident, whether urban or rural, is familiar with. With this familiarity baked into the typography and overall aesthetic of my campaign, I wanted to reinforce a sense of hope and clarity with my colors and iconography.

                    Augmenting current campaign precedents with my design system
                </h1>
                <div class="smallbr"></div>
                Crawford county, the focus of much of my work, is currently doing a really good job surveying its constituents online and via physical mail about their internet connections. As such, I explored how my design system might augment the clarity and visual interest of the surveys and their form of delivery.
                <div class="smallbr"></div>
                Additionally, going along with the theme of roads, I found that billboards are a great way to further publicize the fight for high-speed internet. Unlike a survey in the mail, or a video, a billboard is usually situated in a specific location. That location can be leveraged to communicate specifically to people in the surrounding area.
                <div class="smallbr"></div>
                For example, a billboard in Crawford County would have a map of the street it’s on, and pertinent factoid like:
            </div>
            <img class="more"
            src="../../images/broadband/mockups.png"
            alt="broadband billboard, and physical internet survey with envelope"

            This project forced me to step outside my comfort zone and design for a very specific, unfamiliar audience. For that I am very grateful, and proud of the work it produced.
            <div class="smallbr"> </div>

            However, in the future I would like potentially improve my use of typography within my video, as it does feel like it leaves something to be imagined. Perhaps drawing from the use of type in maps, or just taking cues from existing campaign precedents might be good. If I have the chance, I would also like to see how I can extend the system further, into more comprehensive maps and other forms of advertisements.
