Inspired and assisted by Rossina Soyan, a native Tuvan speaker, researcher, and educator, I wanted to see if I could intuitively bind together audio of a traditional Tuvan storyteller with explanatory, designed visuals.

                Inspired by  Stamps
                </h1>
                <div class="smallbr"> </div>
    
                <b>
                    It was a challenge to find Tuvan resources from which I could draw precedents for my work, however I eventually stumbled upon some beautiful mid-20th Century Tannu Tuva collectible stamps. 
                    
                    <div class="smallbr"> </div>

                    They are somewhat controversial, and for good reason as they were never made to be wholly accurate depictions of Tuvan life, nor were they made to necessarily benefit Tuva much. The stamps were designed by the Soviets, to make money for the Soviets. Simple as that.

                    <div class="smallbr"> </div>

                    Yet they are beautiful and useful, and Rossina feels the same. Another benefit of the stamp style usage is that I do feel some satisfying irony in taking art that once commodified a culture and usings its style entirely in service of telling a cultural story.

        <div class="bigbr"> </div>

        <div class="meat">

        The colors I chose also derive from the stamps. Below are both the darker colors I work with on the left, and the brighter colors which I intend to be outputted within the animation on the right.

            </h1>
            
                <div class="smallbr"> </div>

        Further inspired by the stamps, I wanted to highlight easily communicable words like "elk" and "forest" with an additional layer of stamping. This looped animation builds on the underlying scene just as words can call to mind the living, breathing concepts which they vocally represent.

            So where does the English go?
        </h1>
        
            <div class="smallbr"> </div>
        While I chose not to include English in my animation, I still wanted to have some way for Enlish speakers to gain further context about the story. So I designed and RISO printed a small booklet which both briefly introduces the Tuvan culture, and a displays the English translation of the story right alongside the cyrllic.
