                            Roughly 325,000 businesses, homes, and other establishments lack high-speed internet access in Pennsylvania. The vast majority of these people live within underserved, often overlooked rural communities.

                            <div class="smallbr"> </div>

                            With the support of Aadil Ginwala, senior policy advisor at the Univeristy of Pittsburgh and former chief of staff of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, my task was to propose a potential design system to speak to rural communities and bolster ongoing efforts to close Pennsylvania's digital divide.

                My approach was:
                <div class="smallbr"> </div>    
                1. Finding businesses and municipal buildings in underserved towns that clearly have an existing online presence (a website, google reviews, etc.)
                <div class="smallbr"> </div>    
                2. Reaching out to them, primarily via phone numbers and emails, in the hopes that they would be willing to talk about their experiences with their internet.

            Using <a href="https://internetxplorer.org/#/advertised-service" target="_blank"> Internet Xplorer </a>
            I narrowed down my case study search to Western PA, and began making a list of any possible high-speed internet hotspots surrounded by “dead-zones”, so I could find community members to talk to.
            <div class="smallbr"> </div>    

            My plan seemed alright - but from my results I found that:

                    Only one person, a kind lady in Sandy Lake, answered my call and actually spoke to me for a few minutes about her internet. However, I can’t blame all the other people I contacted - why would they want to talk to me, especially if their internet is serviceable?

            <div class="smallbr"> </div>    

            While my lack of research was a bummer, it reiterated to me that it’s hard to care about the internet conditions of neighbouring towns and counties if you’re not actively  reminded of them.
            <div class="smallbr"></div>
            It was clear then, that my campaign’s direction should be to emphasize the importance of connection, and the similarity between high-speed internet and other connective public necessities like roads and electricity. Basically, local maps were the right way to go. :D
