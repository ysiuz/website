                        In the past, the traditionally nomadic peoples of Tuva would gather around their campfires at night and listen to storytellers regale them. Today however, both this ancient pastime and the Tuvan language itself are endangered due to Russia's encroachment upon Central Asia.

                        Inspired by Dr. Rossina Soyan, a native Tuvan speaker and educator, I am working with motion and print to augment the telling of a tuvan epic, as told by Mr. Sojdak-ool Xovalig.

Rich in color, style, and history, these stamps were once used to commodify Tuvan life for the monetary benefit of Russia. My goal is to co-opt their style in service of telling a singularly Tuvan story.
